# Write a method proctition that accepts an array and a block as arguments. The method
# should return a new array where the elements that return true when given to the block
# come before all of the elements that return false when given to the block. This means
# that the new array has two partitions; the order among elements in the same partition
# should be the same as their relative order in the input array.
